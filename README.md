Project Summary: ZapShift – A parcel delivery & Advanced Logistics Management System.
ZapShift is a high-performance, full-stack parcel delivery and logistics management platform. Designed with the modern "Software as a Service" (SaaS) approach, it bridges the gap between senders, delivery personnel, and business administrators. The platform focuses on automation, data integrity, and a seamless user experience.
1. Core Objectives
The primary goal of ZapShift is to digitize the traditional courier process. It provides a transparent ecosystem where users can book parcels without physical intervention, delivery agents can manage their schedules efficiently, and administrators can oversee the entire business operation through data-driven insights.
2. Technical Architecture & Stack
The project is built using the MERN ecosystem, ensuring scalability and speed:
Frontend: Built with React.js and Vite for optimized build times. Tailwind CSS is used for a responsive, mobile-first UI design.
Backend: Developed using Node.js and Express.js, following a RESTful API architecture.
Database: MongoDB serves as the primary NoSQL database for flexible data modeling.
Authentication & Security: Integrated Firebase Authentication for social/email login and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing private API routes.
Data Management: Utilizes TanStack Query (React Query) for efficient server-state management and Axios for API requests.
3. Key Functional Modules
A. User Dashboard (The Sender)
Dynamic Booking: Users can input parcel details (weight, receiver info, address). The system automatically calculates the delivery cost based on weight.
Real-time Tracking: Users can monitor their parcel's status (Pending, On the Way, Delivered).

B. Delivery Agent Dashboard
Task Management: Agents can view parcels assigned to them by the admin.
Status Updates: Agents have the authority to update parcel statuses and view their delivery history.
Performance Metrics: Tracks the number of successful deliveries and average ratings received.
C. Admin Dashboard (The Control Center)
Comprehensive Analytics: Visual representation of total bookings, revenue, and user growth.
Role Management: Capability to promote users to 'Delivery Agent' or 'Admin' roles.
Assignment Logic: Admins can manually assign pending parcels to specific delivery agents based on availability.

Form Validation: Robust client-side validation using React Hook Form.
Responsive UX: Fully functional on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Scalable Codebase: Organized folder structure separating components, hooks, and API services for easy maintenance.
